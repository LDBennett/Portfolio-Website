				<p>My name is Lee Bennett and I am a web developer. I received my web training through the University of Pittsburgh and various online programs and courses. I currently work as a developer at a local marketing company, and I work as a remote web course developer for an education company. In my freetime, I do freelance work as well. Check out some of my work below! I am always interested in creating new content, so please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

				<p>A litte bit about myself... I am a 27 year old Korean American Adoptee, gaming, psychology majoring, web programming, sci-fi geek. I took an interest in psychology at a very young age and am still interested in it to this day. After I graduated, I decided to receive formal learning on how to program from the University of Pittsburgh. I took various Java and web design/development courses to give me a solid foundation and start on my journey. In addition to my education at Pitt, I am an avid gamer who loves to hop on Xbox or Playstation to play games. You can visit my gaming site <a href="http://www.digitalninjalee.com" target="_blank">DigitalNinjaLee</a> to see some Twitch work, YouTube videos, and what games I play.</p>
